<h1>Lightcurve MC Read-Me</h1>

<p>Lightcurve MC carries out Monte Carlo simulations of statistical light curve analysis, given a fixed observing pattern. The program is designed to be highly flexible with respect to the models adopted and to the statistical tests run on each light curve. The user may select either at run time, allowing for simulation details to be fine-tuned to the problem at hand. While intended for use on Unix-like systems, Lightcurve MC is designed to be built and run on any platform.</p>

<p>More information, including installation instructions, can be found in the Lightcurve MC Reference Manual, provided with the source distribution in <a href="doc/html/index.html">HTML</a> and <a href="doc/latex/refman.pdf">PDF</a> format.</p>
